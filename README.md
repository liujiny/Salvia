# Salvia
I had grown weary of juggling a multitude of different emulators, each requiring its own convoluted hotkey configuration just to navigate or simply exit the application. Consequently, I resolved to build my own frontend from scratch, leveraging the exceptional capabilities of various libretro cores. Compiling each individual core proved to be a formidable challenge in its own right, and developing the frontend itself was by no means a straightforward task. Nevertheless, through sheer perseverance—coupled with invaluable assistance from Claude and Open Code, I managed to overcome the vast majority of the hurdles and technical quirks I encountered. I sincerely hope you enjoy this frontend, as it is fully capable of providing countless hours of entertainment through some of the most influential consoles in history.

**Salvia** is a simple but powerfull frontend for libretro emulators mainly focused to run properly on the Xbox 360, but also able to run on Windows.

## Configuration

### Salvia Frontend directory
Salvia can be installed into any directory (HDD or USB). As a suggestion, I like to leave it in USB0:\Salvia

<img width="694" height="527" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e667993-959c-4f28-8117-97db79dd522b" />

### Bios
The only thing needed for the emulators to work, is to provide the proper bios, as usual on every retroarch frontend. All the files needed can be downloaded from [https://github.com/Abdess/retrobios](https://github.com/Abdess/retrobios/releases/download/v2026.04.02/RetroPie_v1.22.2_Platform_BIOS_Pack.zip).
The system directory should have the following files:

### Roms
**On Xbox 360**, the configuration files are preconfigured to read games from the "Roms" directory located at the root of your USB drive (usb:\roms). To begin, simply extract the "Roms" directory from the release archive and move it to the root of your USB device.

**On Windows**, the system utilizes the default "Roms" directory. You only need to copy your ROMs directly into that folder.

You are now ready to place your backup games into their respective directories:

```

```

To change this paths, you can manually modify the **roms_path** field within the main configuration file (salvia.cfg). Alternatively, this can be adjusted via the in-game menu: Options > Emulation > Roms Main Directory. This property now defines the parent directory for all emulator ROMs. Notably, if configured as usb:\YOUR_ROMS_DIR, the system will dynamically detect the correct USB port, eliminating the need to specify Usb0 or Usb1. To load games from the internal hard disk you must use Hdd:\YOUR_ROMS_DIR

<img width="1275" height="301" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8272f1bb-9f65-4e78-aba9-409f8715476c" />

### Mouse support in XBOX 360
To enable mouse support, it's mandatory for your consele to have the last kernel available 17559, and a DashLaunch plugin must be installed. Inside the salvia-360.zip archive you downloaded previously, you will find a "plugins" directory with a file named hidmouse.xex. Copy that file to the internal hdd of your console or whatever you want, open the dashlaunch utility and add it into the plugins section. 

<img width="1124" height="677" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb0c8cac-4b5e-43d9-84e5-0c9f70c6f9cc" />

After saving and rebooting the console, once you launch Salvia, you will find an icon on your top left screen corner indicating that the mouse support is enabled.

<img width="650" height="511" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7bec58e-1d7a-46ae-85cc-6bfa8111d458" />

> Note that for the plugin to detect the mouse, the console must be booted without the mouse plugged in. Once the Salvia frontend is launched, you can plug the mouse in

### Hotkeys
Hotkeys can be accessed via the menu: Options > Input > Hotkeys. By default, the SELECT button acts as the primary hotkey enabler and must be pressed first, followed by the corresponding function button to execute the desired action. For instance, the 'SELECT + START' combination exits the emulation, returning you to the game selection screen. Another essential shortcut is 'SELECT + Y', which brings up an overlay containing the options menu or returns to the game emulation if pressed again. The remaining options are fairly self-explanatory.

<img width="1279" height="381" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cdfb429-d4f4-40ef-baf9-d13c7808c39e" />

## Core Configurations

### PSX
The psx core needs some .sbi files to work properly with certain PAL titles. If your game hangs or is unable to boot, it's likely to need it. The .sbi files must be copied into the directory system\patches\psx, or alternatively, renamed with the same name as the cd file loaded, but mantaining the .sbi extension in the same directory.

This files can be downloaded from [psxdatacenter.com](https://psxdatacenter.com/sbifiles.html). You can use the Firefox plugin [DownThemAll](https://www.downthemall.net/) to download them easily:

<img width="985" height="458" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/782e1da3-6ca9-492e-a2e2-2b3d5e7daf8e" />

Certain games are only compatible with a DualShock controller. If required by the title, this can be configured directly within the Options menu:
Options > Input > Retropad assignments > Port Controller 1 > Joystick type

<img width="1279" height="276" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce5e9684-40be-452d-8cf4-2a0ce7ded53f" />

### DOSBOX-PURE
This core can load games from a compressed .zip file, but if the game is too big or demanding, it can introduce slowdowns. For this games (like Duke Nukem 3D) it's better to load them uncompressed from a directory

It also may be required a specific joystick type. If the game fails to respond to your controller, adjust the settings within the Options menu:
Options > Input > Retropad assignments > Port Controller 1 > Joystick type

<img width="1279" height="275" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15fcf292-7c27-466e-b28a-1c9aa030ae42" />

This core features a built-in virtual keyboard, which is activated by pressing the L3 stick by default. Once the window appears, you can cycle through the various options using the L and R buttons. This interface allows you to both use the keyboard and map or modify specific keys to the controller buttons.

<img width="1278" height="721" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f5a428b-fc2f-46d2-8ed6-3debee99cdbe" />

### COMMODORE 64 (frodo)
Just select a game and it boots and runs on its own — Salvia auto-types `LOAD"*",8,1` + `RUN` for you once the C64 reaches the `READY.` prompt. Supported formats: `d64`, `t64`, `x64`, `p00`, `prg`, `lnx`, `m3u` and `zip`.

**On-screen keyboard.** Press **L3** to show/hide it. Move with the D-pad, press **A** to type the highlighted key and **B** to close it.

**Program selector.** When a disk holds several programs, a selector pops up on load so you can pick which one to run (D-pad to move, **A** to launch, **B** to cancel). You can bring it back at any time with **R3**.

**Multi-disk games.** Use the **Disk Control** menu (the same one used for PlayStation) to swap disks *without* resetting the machine:
* Put an `.m3u` playlist next to your disks (one disk filename per line) and load the `.m3u`; then choose **Next Disk** whenever the game asks you to insert the next disk.
* Or open **Select Disk** to pick another `.d64` from the same folder.

Most commercial / multi-disk games use custom or turbo loaders that require **True Drive Emulation** (cycle-exact 1541 drive). Enable it in the core options (`frodo_true_drive`) — it is far more compatible (copy protection, fast loaders, multi-disk RPGs) but slower, and it only works with `.d64` images. Leave it **off** for simple single-file games, where it is unnecessary and faster. Note that with True Drive, loading takes roughly as long as it did on real hardware.

**Controls.** The pad drives C64 joystick **port 2** by default (used by most games); switch to port 1 with `frodo_joystick_port` if a game needs it. The numeric keypad also works as a joystick.

**Other core options:** SID sound engine and filters, drive activity LEDs, fast reset, sprite collisions and optional REU RAM expansion.

### ATARI 8-BIT / 5200 (atari800)
Runs the Atari 400/800/XL/XE home computers and the Atari 5200 console. Supported formats include `atr`, `xfd`, `xex`, `com`, `car`, `rom`, `a52` (5200), `cas`, `bin`, `atx`, `m3u` and `zip`.

**On-screen keyboard.** Press **L3** to show/hide it (D-pad to move, **A** to type, **B** to close) — very useful for the many Atari titles that expect keyboard input.

**BIOS.** The core boots with the built-in AltirraOS by default, so it works out of the box. If you prefer the real Atari ROMs, drop them into the `system` directory and they will be detected automatically.

**Controller type.** Some games (and the 5200) need a specific controller device. Set it in Options > Input > Retropad assignments > Port Controller 1 > Joystick type.

Multi-disk Atari (`.atr`) games can also be swapped from the **Disk Control** menu using an `.m3u` playlist, exactly like the C64 core.

### Amiga 500/1200/CD32 (puae2021 and puae)
For Amiga 500, the puae2021 core runs fullspeed out of the box, emulating up to A600. If you want to emulate Amiga 1200 or CD32, frameskip is highly recommended (`Core Options > Video > Frameskip` set to 1). It's also important to have the Audio Synchronization activated to this core, as it sets the internal framerate to 25fps while maintaining a frameskip of 1, producing an effective framerate of 50fps. By default the `Options > Emulation > System Advanced Settings > Amiga 1200/CD32` will be set to that value.

To load multidiskette games, the easiest thing to do is to launch a compressed .zip file with the required files inside

```
Alien Breed - Tower Assault (OCS & AGA).zip
   └── Alien Breed - Tower Assault (OCS & AGA)_Disk1.adf
   └── Alien Breed - Tower Assault (OCS & AGA)_Disk2.adf
   └── Alien Breed - Tower Assault (OCS & AGA)_Disk3.adf
   └── Alien Breed - Tower Assault (OCS & AGA)_Disk4.adf
```
When the game ask you to change disk, it can be done easily cycling diskettes with the menu: `Options > Emulation > Disks Control > Next Disk`

### FBNEO and FBANext
For this core, there are two subdirectories available **neocd** (to load neogeo cd games) and  **megadrive** (it can load megadrive games for the fbneo core, but its main purpose is to load the game Paprium as Genesis-plus-gx is the gold standard for megadrive)

Some games should run fullspeed but the fbneo team introduced some changes that make them slower than it should be (Altered Beast for example). For these game, use the alternative emulator FBANext

### MAME 2003 Plus
For the games that need a chd file to work, they should be placed in the same folder as the roms directory. Example for the game Killer Instinct (sad example because in XBOX 360 runs terribly slow):

```
Usb0:\Roms
└── mame2003\            
    └── roms\
        └── kinst.zip
        └── kinst\
            └── kinst.chd
```

The samples files, though, should be placed into the system directory

```
system
└── mame2003-plus/
    ├── artwork/
    ├── **samples/** armora.zip ... zektor.zip (samples .zip files)
    └── hiscore.dat
```

#### Paprium
To run this game, the following files must be present. Additionally, upon launching the game for the first time, you will be prompted to select your preferred language. Once selected, the game requires a restart, and this preference will be saved for future sessions.

The files needed must be placed in the following directories. Take into account that the music files are usually in mp3 format. To avoid slowdowns and reduce the memory footprint for Xbox 360, convert them to wav files. I recommend this portable conversion tool [fre:ac Portable](https://portableapps.com/apps/music_video/freac_portable)

```
system
└── fbneo/
    └── samples/
        └── paprium/ (01 Theme of Paprium.wav ... 52 Waterfront Beat.wav --> 52 .wav files)
```
```
Usb0:\Roms
└── fbneo\               (Arcade FBNeo --> zip cue ccd chd)
    └── megadrive\       (FBNeo Megadrive core)
        └── paprium.zip  (Paprium game containing 'Paprium (World)(2020)(WaterMelon).bin')
```
#### Other FBNEO cores
The MSX, ZX-Spectrum and NeoGeo Pocket (ngp now supported also by beetle-ngp) rely on FBNEO. Search a compatible romset for these cores.
For MSX and ZX Spectrum cores, an on-screen overlay keyboard is available and can be enabled by pressing the default shortcut SELECT + X

### QUAKE
To load the right episode or mod of quake, a subdirectory must be created for each of them. The structure should be as follows:
```
Usb0:\Roms
└── quake\
    ├── id1\ 
    │   ├── music
    │   │   └── track02.ogg ... track11.ogg (10 .ogg files)
    │   ├── pak0.pak
    │   └── pak1.pak
    └── hipnotic\ 
        ├── music
        │   └── track02.ogg ... track09.ogg (8 .ogg files)
        └── pak0.pak
```
### DOOM
To load the right episode or mod of Doom, the wad files should be copied on the prboom directory. The structure should be as follows:
```
Usb0:\Roms
└── prboom\
    ├── DOOM.WAD

## Cheats

Salvia supports cheats through the standard RetroArch cheat files (`.cht`), the same ones hosted in the [libretro cheat database](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database/tree/master/cht).

### Enabling cheats
1. Load a game and open the in-game menu.
2. Go to **Cheats** and switch **ON** the ones you want — they take effect immediately.

Cheats always start **disabled** each time you load a game, so you only turn on what you need.

### Downloading them automatically
If the **Cheats** menu shows no cheats for the current game, select **Download cheats**. Salvia looks the game up in the libretro cheat database and downloads the matching `.cht` for you (an internet connection is required). The list refreshes automatically when it finishes. **Reload .cht** re-reads the file from disk.

> The first time you download for a given system, Salvia also fetches and caches that system's cheat list, so that first lookup can take a few seconds.

### Adding them manually
You can also download the `.cht` yourself from the [libretro cheat database](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database/tree/master/cht): open your system's folder and grab the file for your game.

Copy it into the **`data/cheats/<core>/`** directory — the `<core>` subfolder is named after the core (the same name used for your save files) — and rename the file to **match your ROM name** (without the extension):

```
data/
└── cheats/
    ├── Genesis Plus GX/
    │   └── Sonic The Hedgehog (USA, Europe).cht
    └── PCSXR-360/
        └── Crash Bandicoot (USA).cht
```

For example, a ROM named `Sonic The Hedgehog (USA, Europe).md` running on *Genesis Plus GX* needs the file `data/cheats/Genesis Plus GX/Sonic The Hedgehog (USA, Europe).cht`.

The `data/cheats/<core>/` folder is created automatically the first time you launch a game with that core (just like `data/saves` and `data/states`). After copying a file, reload the game or pick **Reload .cht** in the Cheats menu.

### Which cheat variant to use (per system)

The libretro cheat database offers each game in several *device* variants — `(Game Genie)`, `(GameShark)`, `(Action Replay)`, `(Pro Action Replay)`, `(Code Breaker)`… — and each core only understands some of them. When you use **Download cheats**, Salvia already picks the right variant for the system automatically, so you don't need to worry about this. It only matters when you grab the `.cht` **yourself**:

| System (core) | `.cht` variant to use |
| --- | --- |
| NES (nestopia) | **Game Genie** — the *Action Replay* files use a raw format this core can't read |
| Mega Drive / Genesis / Sega CD / 32X (genesis-plus-gx, picodrive) | **Game Genie**, or **GameShark** / **Action Replay** / **Pro Action Replay** |
| Master System / Game Gear | **Game Genie** or **Action Replay** |
| SNES (snes9x) | **Game Genie** or **Pro Action Replay** |
| Game Boy / Color (gambatte) | **Game Genie** or **GameShark** |
| Game Boy Advance (vba-next) | **GameShark** / **Action Replay**, or **Code Breaker** |
| PC Engine / TurboGrafx-16 / CD (beetle-pce, beetle-pce-fast) | **Action Replay** / raw (no Game Genie) |
| SuperGrafx (beetle-supergrafx) | **Action Replay** / raw |
| WonderSwan (beetle-wswan) | **Action Replay** / raw |
| PlayStation (pcsxr-360) | **GameShark** — *not* Game Buster |

### Notes
- Cheats only work on cores that support them. **Not supported:** DOSBox, 3DO and **Virtual Boy**.
- **Doom** (prboom) and **Quake** (tyrquake) accept their engine's own cheats, not RAM codes. These aren't in the online database, so you make the `.cht` yourself with the classic strings in the `code` field — Doom cheat codes (`iddqd`, `idkfa`, `idclip`, `idbeholdv`…) or Quake console commands (`god`, `noclip`, `impulse 9`…). Note: Doom cheats can't be switched back off once applied.
- **arcade (FBNeo / MAME)** have their own cheats engine
- Whatever the device name, the code inside must match the format the core expects — the variants listed in the table above are the ones known to work on each system.

## Background music
To add your own music while navigating through the menus, you can copy your mp3 files into the directory Usb0:\Salvia\assets\music
There is an already provided default song named menu.mp3, but you can choose whatever music file you want for each independent core accessing to: 

```
Options > Emulation > System Advanced Settings > [Megadrive, nes...]
```
There is also a new menu option **Audio**, where you can disable the music or set a general volume.

## MIDI music
Some systems played their music on an external MIDI module instead of the internal sound chip: the X68000 with its CZ-6BM1 board, DOS games with a Roland module, and Doom. Salvia has a built-in MIDI synthesizer so that music can be heard.

All you need is a **SoundFont** file (`.sf2`) copied into the system directory:

```
system/
├── Roland_SC-55.sf2
└── ... (your other bios files)
```

Then pick it in:

```
Options > Audio
```

| Option | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **MIDI synthesizer** | Turns it on or off |
| **SoundFont (.sf2)** | Which bank to use, from the ones found in `system` |
| **MIDI volume** | Music volume, in 10% steps |
| **MIDI module** | Leave it on *Auto-detect*. See the MT-32 note below |

On Xbox 360 prefer a small bank. A SoundFont takes about **twice its file size in RAM** while you play, so a 50 MB one costs around 100 MB. It is only loaded when a game actually needs MIDI, so it costs nothing for the rest of the systems.

### Turning it on in each core

The synthesizer is only half of it: each core has to be told to send its music out as MIDI.

**X68000 (px68k)** — set `MIDI Output` to `enabled` in the core options. Most games also need a key held down **while the game boots**:

| Game | Hold while booting |
| --- | --- |
| Granada, Sol-Feace | **R2** on the pad (or ScrollLock) |
| Atomic Robo-Kid | **F1** |
| Gemini Wing | **F1** (MT-32) / **F2** (CM-64) |

**Doom (prboom)** — in Doom's own menu, go to Options > Setup > General and set **MIDI Hardware** to the libretro option. It is remembered for next time.

**DOS (DOSBox-Pure)** — set its `MIDI Output` core option to `Frontend MIDI driver`. Careful: if you leave it on a `.sf2`, it uses its own synthesizer instead of Salvia's, which also works fine.

### A note about MT-32 games
Most X68000 games, and many DOS ones, were written for a **Roland MT-32**, which is a different kind of synthesizer, not a General MIDI one. Salvia detects those games and translates their instruments to the closest General MIDI equivalents, so the music plays correctly and in tune, but it will not sound exactly like a real MT-32. Games that load their own custom instruments will differ the most.

If a game sounds wrong and you know which module it expects, you can force it with the **MIDI module** option.

## Games artwork and titles
### Built-in scraper
To be able to scrap your local games, you must first register into the following link: [screenscraper.fr](https://www.screenscraper.fr/membreinscription.php)

Once you are registered, you must enter your username and password using the menu: Options > Scraper > Other configuration > User | Password

### Specify artwork directories
If you don't want to use the builtin scraper, you can add your images and text for each game manually. The images must be in png format and the description must be a .txt file. To be able to do that, you must create this directory structure for the emulator. For example, to add images and text descriptions for the mame core:

```
Usb0:\Salvia\assets\mame
├── box2d\ (An image of the game box cartridge)
|   └── 3countb.png ... zzyzzyxx.png (2919 .png files)
├── snap\ (An ingame screenshot)
|   └── 3countb.png ... zzyzzyxx.png (2919 .png files)
├── snaptit\ (A game's title screenshot)
|   └── 3countb.png ... zzyzzyxx.png (2919 .png files)
└── synopsis\
    └── 1on1gov.txt ... zzyzzyxx2.txt (37751 .txt files)
```

The images can be easily found on internet, but to generate the synopsys directory files, a script is provided in the utils\extract_history.ps1 git main path. To execute it, edit its content and modify the $baseDir line with a directory path containing the MAME "history.xml" file. Open a "Windows power shell" and execute it. 

<img width="591" height="158" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3676f16c-d8fe-4a1a-9768-fd666ea002e3" />

### Games titles
Some emulators like MAME or Final Burn Neo/Alpha, have short rom filenames that make really difficult to differenciate which game is which, so, to translate them, some files are prepared in the main distribution of the salvia frontend. The location is the following:

```
Usb0:\Salvia\assets\extra
├── merged_mame.xml
├── merged_fbneo.xml
└── merged_ngp_spectrum_msx.xml
```
Furthermore, each file must be referentiated into the mame_roms_xml property of the .cfg file for each emulator 

```
mame_roms_xml = assets\extra\merged_mame.xml
```

if you want manually generate the titles for each game, a script is provided in the utils\merge_mame_files.ps1 git main path. This script needs the .dat or .xml files provided for MAME or FBNEO, and generates a reduced xml with the important information extracted. For example, the merged-* files described above where generated with the following files

- fbneo.dat
- MAME 0.284.dat
- mame2003-plus.xml
